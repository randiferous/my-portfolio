            <p className="is-size-4 is-size-5-mobile has-text-centered-mobile">
                Korean-American born and raised in New York.
                A practitioner of street-dance, a big sports fan, and a seasoned traveler.
                Once I began learning how to code and realized how natural it came to me, I never turned back.
                My experience with the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp has been an enjoyable one, where every
                piece of new knowledge brings the excitement of new possibilities.
                There, I have established my skills in front-end and back-end technologies, while honing my ability
                to collaborate with others.
                I look forward to the next part of this journey: joining a professional team with whom my work is
                meaningful and I can continue to grow.
